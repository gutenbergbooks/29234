<p><i>As a social document, the collection of presentation pieces,
mostly silver, in the United States National Museum provides
evidence of the taste and craftsmanship in America at various
periods from the mid-18th century to the 1920&#8217;s.</i></p>
<p><i>Although the representative items selected for illustration confirm
the view that such pieces often lack artistic merit, the
collection nevertheless reveals the deeds&ndash;&ndash;in war, politics, technology,
diplomacy, sports&ndash;&ndash;that our forebears deemed worthy of
special recognition. And it helps to bring alive some figures
now submerged in our ever-expanding history.</i></p>
<p><span class='smcap'>The author:</span> <i>Margaret Brown Klapthor is associate curator
of political history in the Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s Museum of
History and Technology.</i></p>
</div>
<p class="dropcap" ><span class="dcap">The custom of giving a piece of silver</span> to
an individual in recognition of service or in appreciation
of accomplishment probably began as
soon as man developed the fashioning of that metal
into objects. Such a presentation piece was a tangible
and durable form of recognition which could
be appreciated, used, displayed, and enjoyed by the
recipient. Many of these silver pieces became for
succeeding generations the cherished evidence of recognition
accorded to an ancestor, and they were preserved
long after the more customary family silver
had worn out or been lost.</p>
<p>The Smithsonian Institution&#8217;s Museum of History
and Technology has what may well be the most
varied and extensive collection of such presentation
pieces ever to be preserved and exhibited in one place.
The collection contains the work of some of the more
prominent American silversmiths, but most of the
pieces are by lesser known makers and are in the collection
because of historic interest rather than artistic
merit. The chief usefulness of the collection lies in
its value as a social document and in the mute evidence
it gives of the taste and craftsmanship of the periods
covered. The collection is also helpful in dating type
specimens that do not have specific associations with
persons and dates. Perhaps even more interesting than
the gamut of styles that the collection presents is the
panorama of deeds, events, and persons that our forebears
considered worthy of recognition. Silver presentation
pieces were awarded to persons in almost
every walk of life&ndash;&ndash;to military men, to peace-loving
Indians, and to men who achieved success in politics
and agriculture. They were given for sea rescues,
for heroic deeds by firemen and school-patrol boys,
and for outstanding community and civic work.
Within our time they have been given as trophies for
excellence in athletics, automobile racing, and many
other events.</p>

<h2><a name='EIGHTEENTH' id='EIGHTEENTH'></a>18th-Century Pieces</h2>
<p>Silversmiths have been making presentation pieces
from the earliest days of our country, but the Smithsonian
Institution has only a few 18th-century pieces
in its collection.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>The earliest of these is an inlaid silver snuffbox
(<a href='#linki_3'>fig. 2</a>) made by William Cario, who worked in
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, about 1763. The oval
box&ndash;&ndash;evidently a gift to the silversmith&#8217;s second wife,
Lydia Croxford, whom he married in 1768&ndash;&ndash;has inscribed
on its base &#8220;The property of Lydia Cario&#8221;
and &#8220;1769.&#8221; The cover has an undersurface of horn,
and the silver on the outer surface is inlaid with
mother-of-pearl and tortoise shell in a filigree pattern.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Many of the earliest pieces of presentation silver
were made for use in churches, and they were given
by groups as well as by individuals. Representative
of this type is a silver alms plate<a name='FNanchor_0001' id='FNanchor_0001'></a><a href='#Footnote_0001' class='fnanchor'>[1]</a> with the following
inscription on the rim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Gift of the
Hon<sup>ble</sup>
<span class='smcap'>thomas hancock
esq<sup>r</sup></span>
to the
<span class='smcap'>church</span> in Brattle Street Boston 1764.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plate is shallow with a slightly domed center.
Engraved on the flat rim, in addition to the inscription,
is a crest at the top and the cherub&#8217;s head at the
bottom. The piece is marked by John Coburn, who
lived in Boston from 1725 to 1803. Five trays
matching this one are in the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts.<a name='FNanchor_0002' id='FNanchor_0002'></a><a href='#Footnote_0002' class='fnanchor'>[2]</a></p>

Figure 3.&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>Mark of Samuel Minott</span> and monogram of Elias Hasket Derby on silver tankard. Bequest of Arthur Michaels. In Division of Cultural History. (Acc. 162866, cat. 383545; Smithsonian photos 44828-D, 44828-F.)<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="nowrap">A silver tankard</span> made by Samuel Minott, who
worked in Boston from about 1765 to 1803, can be
accurately placed by the account of ownership
thoughtfully inscribed on its base by one of its later
owners. The legend reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style='text-align:left'>Richard Derby to E. S. Hasket Derby 1763<br />
John Derby<br />
George Derby 1831<br />
Roger Derby 1874<br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tankard has a tapered, ringed body, an <span class="sshape">S</span>-shaped
handle with a plain boss at the end, a scroll thumb-piece,
a flat molded drop ornament on the handle,
and a domed cover with an acorn finial. On the
body beneath the Derby coat of arms, is monogrammed
&#8220;E&nbsp;H&nbsp;D&#8221; for Elias Hasket Derby (<a href='#linki_4'>fig. 3</a>).
Elias Hasket Derby achieved wealth and fame as a
Salem merchant prince engaged in the China trade.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></div>
<p>Similar in design to these 18th-century pieces is a
standing cup<a name='FNanchor_0003' id='FNanchor_0003'></a><a href='#Footnote_0003' class='fnanchor'>[3]</a> or chalice with the inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented by the Sisters of the New South Church for its
communion service&ndash;&ndash;January 1, 1815.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cup, with a concave body and a baluster stem
with a square foot, is marked &#8220;Moulton&#8221; and is in
the style of Ebenezer Moulton who worked in Boston
between 1768 and 1824.</p>
<hr class='major' />
<h2 class="padtop"><a name='NINETEENTH' id='NINETEENTH'></a>19th-Century Pieces</h2>
<p>The collections of the United States National
Museum that cover the political, cultural, military,
and technological history of America in the 19th
century are probably without rival, and the collection
of presentation silver is no exception. The recognition
of military prowess by the presentation of silver objects
was especially popular during this century.</p>
<h3>FOR SERVICE IN WAR OF 1812</h3>
<p>Some handsome pieces of silver of the federal style
were given for service in the War of 1812. Historically
the most important of these is a mammoth
punch set (<a href='#linki_5'>fig. 4</a>) presented to Colonel George
Armistead by the citizens of Baltimore in recognition
of his services in the defense of Fort McHenry against
the British attack in 1814. The service includes an
oval silver tray with a handle on each end, the whole
of which is supported on six winged-claw feet. The
tray is 29 inches long and 22 inches wide.</p>
<p>The ball-shaped punch bowl,
12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches in diameter,
is supported by four eagles mounted on a round
base. There is a loop handle of silver rope on each
side. The bowl is an exact copy in size and design of
the mortar bombs the British hurled at the fort. On
one side of the bowl is the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented by a number of the citizens of Baltimore to Lieutenant
Colonel George Armistead for his gallant and successful
defense of Fort McHenry during the bombardment
by a large British Force, on the 12th and 13th September
1814 when upwards of 1500 shells were thrown; 400 of which
fell within the area of the Fort and some of them of the
diameter of this vase.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Note the discrepancy in the dates of the inscription.
The Battle of Fort McHenry was fought on the 13th
and 14th of September 1814.)</p>

Figure 4.&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>Punch set</span> presented to Col. George Armistead by the citizens of Baltimore in recognition of his services in the defense of Fort McHenry against the British in 1814. Gift of Alexander Gordon, Jr., great-grandson of the recipient. In Division of Political History. (Acc. 6642, cats. 30914-17; Smithsonian photo P-64357.)<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>On the other side is engraved a view of Fort McHenry
and Baltimore Harbor. The bowl is marked by
Thomas Fletcher and Sidney Gardiner, silversmiths
who worked in Philadelphia from 1814 to 1838. In
regard to the excellence of the work of these silversmiths,
there is an interesting comment in a diary of
Philip Hone that is owned by the New-York Historical
Society. On February 14, 1838, Hone wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fletcher and Co. are the artist who made the Clinton
vases. Nobody in this &#8220;world&#8221; of ours hereabouts can compete
with them in their kind of work.<a name='FNanchor_0004' id='FNanchor_0004'></a><a href='#Footnote_0004' class='fnanchor'>[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the set are ten silver cups, each
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches high
and 3 inches in diameter. The cups have the same
rounded shape as the bowl, without the loop handles,
and are marked on the bottom by Andrew E. Warner,
a silversmith who was working in Baltimore from
1805 until his death in 1870.</p>
<p>The ladle, in the same shape as the cups, is also
marked by Warner.</p>
<p>During the defense of Fort McHenry Colonel
Armistead had under him about 1,000 men, including
soldiers, sailors, and volunteers. It is said he was
the only man aware of the alarming fact that the
powder magazine was not bombproof. During the
night of September 13 the fort was under constant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
bombardment by the enemy, but the attack failed.
Discouraged by the loss of the British general in land
action, and finding that the shallow water and sunken
ships prevented a close approach to the city by
water, the British fleet withdrew. Fort McHenry
was but little damaged and loss of life was small.</p>

<p>The oval-shaped tureen is mounted on a square base
that stands on four winged feet. The piece is 15
inches high. The handles at each end are supported
by eagles&#8217; heads. An applied design of flying horses
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
and winged cherub heads makes an attractive border
around the edge of the tureen. The knob on the
cover of the tureen is a stylized bunch of grapes.
On the inside of the bottom of the base is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented by the citizens of Baltimore to Commodore John
Rodgers in testimony of their sense of the important aid
afforded by him in the defense of Baltimore on the 12th
and 13th of
Sept&#8217;<sup>r</sup>,
1814.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This piece too bears the mark of Philadelphia silversmiths
Fletcher and Gardiner.</p>

<h3>FOR PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP</h3>
<p>Unusual in the Museum&#8217;s collection of presentation
silver is the treaty pipe (<a href='#linki_8'>fig. 7</a>) formally presented to
the Delaware Indians in 1814 by General William
Henry Harrison at the conclusion of the second Treaty
of Greenville.</p>
<p>The treaty was intended to commit the Indians to
active resistance in the American cause during the
War of 1812. General Harrison and Lewis Cass had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
been appointed commissioners by the U.S. Government
to conclude the treaty. On July 8, 1814,
General Harrison read to the Indians a message from
the President of the United States, and afterward he
presented to the Wyandotte, Delaware, and Shawnee
Indian tribes large silver pipes elegantly ornamented
and engraved with emblems signifying the protection
and friendship of the United States.<a name='FNanchor_0005' id='FNanchor_0005'></a><a href='#Footnote_0005' class='fnanchor'>[5]</a></p>

</p>
</div>
<p>The pipe presented to the Delaware Indians has an
urn-shaped bowl with a bead-edged cover bearing
acanthus-leaf decorations. The <span class="sshape">S</span>-shaped stem is 21
inches long and only one-fourth inch in diameter.
The great length of the stem was necessary to cool
the smoke; the <span class="sshape">S</span>-shape added rigidity to the silver.
The piece undoubtedly is the work of a competent
craftsman but it bears no identifying mark.<a name='FNanchor_0006' id='FNanchor_0006'></a><a href='#Footnote_0006' class='fnanchor'>[6]</a></p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Although not exactly a pipe of peace, another pipe
in the collections of the Museum represents a gesture
of friendship between nations. It is a meerschaum
pipe<a name='FNanchor_0007' id='FNanchor_0007'></a><a href='#Footnote_0007' class='fnanchor'>[7]</a> with a silver lid on the bowl and with a silver
mouthpiece. The lid bears this inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This pipe was presented to Sir Frederick Hankey by the
Grand Vizier of Turkey at Constantinople in the year 1830
and to Thomas Hankey
Esq<sup>re</sup>
by the Daughter of Sir
Frederick and by him to Charles Alexander
Esq<sup>re</sup>
9th
March, 1873.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only information that has been obtained about
Hankey is that he held an official position as Chief
Secretary of Malta for the British Government.</p>
<h3>FOR POLITICS</h3>
<p>In 1838 the Whig Young Men of New York City
presented to Robert Charles Wetmore a pair of large,
ornate, silver pitchers<a name='FNanchor_0008' id='FNanchor_0008'></a><a href='#Footnote_0008' class='fnanchor'>[8]</a> inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Robert Charles Wetmore their late Chairman from the
General Committee of Whig Young Men of the City of
New York a Memorial of political fellowship, a token of
personal esteem and a tribute of patriotic service 1838.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bases of the pitchers are engraved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Chas Fredk Wetmore by his father, January 1st,
1840.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These pitchers were made by Geradus Boyce, a New
York silversmith who worked in the first half of the
19th century.</p>
<h3>FOR SERVICE IN THE MEXICAN, CIVIL, AND INDIAN WARS</h3>
<p>Most of these pieces, like the pitchers mentioned
above, are not as pleasing aesthetically as the earlier
ones, and they are much more closely allied with the
exuberance of the Victorian era than they are with
the classical lines of the Federal period.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A large, elaborate vase<a name='FNanchor_0009' id='FNanchor_0009'></a><a href='#Footnote_0009' class='fnanchor'>[9]</a> with two handles and a
cover was presented to Major General Silas Casey,
U.S.A., in recognition of his services during the
Mexican War. The vase is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Capt. Silas Casey, 2 inf. U.S.A. For his bravery and
skill at Contreras, Churubusco and other battles of Mexico;
for his gallant leading of the storming party of Regulars at
Chapultepec where he was severely wounded. The gift of
citizens of his native town and others, E. Greenwich, Rhode
Island, August 1848.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The vase is marked on the bottom with box-enclosed
letters &#8220;G &amp; H&#8221; and &#8220;1848.&#8221; The letters probably
refer to Gale and Hughes, New York silversmiths, or
perhaps to Gale and Hayden, who were in business
about the same time.</p>
<p>Casey, a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy,
received votes of thanks from the Rhode Island
legislature for his services in both the Mexican and
Civil Wars.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Lieutenant Colonel John Bankhead Magruder was
given a silver pitcher by his friends in Baltimore for his
Mexican War service. The pitcher<a name='FNanchor_0010' id='FNanchor_0010'></a><a href='#Footnote_0010' class='fnanchor'>[10]</a> is urn-shaped,
has a long, narrow neck, and stands on a tall base.
The entire pitcher is elaborate repouss&eacute; in a design of
roses, sunflowers, and grapes. An arched and turreted
castle is depicted on each side, and on the center front
is the inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Lt. Col. J. Bankhead Magruder by his Baltimore
friends as a token of their appreciation of his Meritorious
Services in the Mexican War, October 16, 1849.</p>
</blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></div>
<p>On the inside of the base are the marks &#8220;S. Kirk &amp;
Son&#8221; and &#8220;11 oz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Magruder graduated from the U.S. Military Academy
in 1830, and his military career encompassed
service under three flags within a period of 35 years.
In the Mexican War he was brevetted major for
gallantry at Cerro Gordo and lieutenant colonel for
Chapultepec, where he was severely wounded. At
the outbreak of the Civil War, Colonel Magruder, a
native of Virginia, entered the Confederate Army and
was soon placed in command of the Department of
Texas, where he served until the close of the war. He
then entered the army of Maximilian in Mexico as
major general and was in active service until Maximilian&#8217;s
capture and execution. When he returned
to the United States he settled in Houston and died
there in 1871.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A silver service (<a href='#linki_9'>fig. 8</a>) consisting of four goblets,
pitcher, and tray, presented to Brevet Major General
John Porter Hatch, U.S. Volunteers, is interesting
because it was given in recognition of services during
the Mexican War, the Indian expeditions of 1857-1859,
and the Civil War. The gift is from Hatch&#8217;s fellow
citizens of Oswego, New York.</p>

<p>The silver tray measures 15 by 20 inches and is
decorated with four small waterscapes and a flower
design. It is raised on four short scroll feet. The

<p>The pitcher (14 inches high and 7 inches in diameter)
has a design of grapevines and birds. The
spout is in the form of a face, and the handle represents
entwined vines. It is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The four silver goblets are also decorated with grape
vines and birds, and they have gilt interiors. They
are 8 inches high and
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches in diameter. Each
goblet has the inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Testimonial of the Citizens of Oswego, N.Y. to Genl. John
P. Hatch, Jan. 1863.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below this inscription each goblet is marked with one

</blockquote>
<p>Each goblet is marked &#8220;Tiffany &amp; Co.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hatch graduated from the Academy in 1845 and
immediately saw active service in the Mexican War.
He fought not only in General Taylor&#8217;s campaign in
northern Mexico but also in General Scott&#8217;s campaign
to capture Mexico City. In the years intervening
before the Civil War he saw active service in Indian
campaigns and took part in a number of scouting expeditions.
With the outbreak of the Civil War he was
assigned with the Volunteers in the Army of the Potomac
until he was severely wounded at South Mountain,
for which action he received the Congressional
Medal of Honor. He spent the rest of the Civil War
on duty behind the lines where he was in command
of various districts in the Department of the South
following Sherman&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>The largest and most elaborate set of presentation
silver in the Museum is a complete table service (<a href='#linki_10'>fig.
9</a>) that was given to General Judson Kilpatrick by the
Veterans Association of Connecticut on the occasion
of his marriage to a Chilean in 1868 while he was serving
as U.S. Minister to Chile. The set is engraved
with emblems of the United States, Chile, the U.S.
Army, and the U.S. Navy. The monograms on the
individual pieces are in gold of four colors. More
than any other silver service in the Museum this one
may be said to epitomize the elaborate realism so
popular during the height of the Victorian era.</p>

<p>The pieces are marked &#8220;Meriden B * <span class="nowrap">Company *&#8221;</span>
in a circle around a shield surmounted by balanced
scales. This mark was used in the second half of the
19th century by the Meriden Britannia Company for

base of silver nickel.<a name='FNanchor_0011' id='FNanchor_0011'></a><a href='#Footnote_0011' class='fnanchor'>[11]</a></p>
<p>There are two trays in the set. The smaller tray
is shown in figure 9. The larger one measures
22<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches by 38 inches and is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Veteran Soldiers of Connecticut to Kilpatrick</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is engraved in gold and silver with flags of the
United States and Chile crossed with bayonets and
spears. On one side there is a center medallion in
gold with the monogram &#8220;L&nbsp;V&nbsp;K&#8221; (for Luisa V.
Kilpatrick) in a circle surmounted on a shield of
stars and stripes. Above the monogram there is a
banner with three stars and a triangle. On the other
side of the standing piece two eagles in fighting position
are shown in front of a sunburst design. The
United States flag can be seen directly behind the
victorious eagle. The motto &#8220;Tuebor&#8221; is at the top
of the sunburst. The entire design is encircled by a
ring of stars, and there is a shield of stars and stripes
at the top. This same design is repeated on all 40
pieces.</p>
<p>The service contains napkin rings, vegetable dishes,
syrup jar, spoon holder, large centerpiece, porcelain-lined
pitcher, and other miscellaneous pieces of silver
used for table service. The pieces of the tea and
coffee service are mounted on four feet that are fastened
to the bowl with cattle heads with branched
horns. Each foot stands on a cloven hoof. The knob
of each of the pots is a tiny horse jumping over a
four-bar hurdle.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>One of the most interesting military presentation
pieces in the collection is a silver and copper shield
presented to Lieutenant General Nelson A. Miles,
U.S. Army, by the officers of the 5th Infantry Regiment.
General Miles served for many years as colonel
of the regiment and led it in a number of notable
Indian engagements. Beginning in 1869 his regiment
defeated the Cheyenne, Kiowa, Comanche, Sioux, Nez
Perc&eacute;, and Bannock Indians, and, in 1886, after a long
and difficult campaign, Miles compelled the surrender
of the Apaches under Geronimo and Natchez.</p>
<p>The heart-shaped shield<a name='FNanchor_0012' id='FNanchor_0012'></a><a href='#Footnote_0012' class='fnanchor'>[12]</a> is surrounded by a rolled
edge made of copper which originally had a gold wash.
Inscribed on the inside of the rolled edge are the names
&#8220;New Mexico,&#8221; &#8220;Kansas,&#8221; &#8220;Wyoming,&#8221; &#8220;Montana,&#8221;
&#8220;Dakota,&#8221; &#8220;Colorado,&#8221; &#8220;Indian Territory,&#8221; and
&#8220;Texas.&#8221; A profile portrait of General Miles, in
relief, is suspended from an eagle&#8217;s beak in the center,
and below are the crossed weapons of the U.S. Army
and the Indians surmounted by a peace pipe.</p>
<p>The background of the shield is silver with etched
scenes depicting incidents of the career of General
Miles in the states named. The scenes depicted are
of a buffalo hunt, a covered wagon on the trail, wild
horses with Indian tepees in the background, an Army
council of war, General Miles receiving the surrender
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
of Chief Joseph of the Nez Perc&eacute; Indians, and a peaceful
agricultural scene.</p>
<p>The plaque is inscribed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to General Nelson A. Miles, U.S. Army, by the
officers of the fifth U.S. Infantry. As a token of personal
esteem and their estimate of his distinguished services in
which unequaled successes over savages in war were
paralleled by humanity and justice towards the thousands of
Indians whom he took captive and instructed in the Arts
of Civilization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The plaque, measuring
18<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
by 23 inches overall, is
marked &#8220;Tiffany &amp; Co., 6565. Makers 2, Sterling
Silver, 926-1000 and Other Metals, M.&#8221;</p>
<p>General Miles was colonel of the 5th Infantry
Regiment for so many years that a modification of his
family crest was selected as the crest on the coat of
arms of the regiment. The Miles family crest is an
arm in armor grasping an anchor. Arrows for each
Indian campaign in which the regiment took part are
substituted for the anchor in the regimental crest.<a name='FNanchor_0013' id='FNanchor_0013'></a><a href='#Footnote_0013' class='fnanchor'>[13]</a></p>

<h3>TO MARY TODD LINCOLN</h3>
<p>The Museum recently received a silver service (<a href='#linki_11'>fig.
10</a>) that belonged to Mary Todd Lincoln. The service
consists of a large oval tray, a hot-water urn on a stand
with a burner, coffeepot, teapot, hot-water pot, cream
pitcher, sugar urn, and waste bowl. All the pieces
have an overall repouss&eacute; floral and strapwork pattern
with the monogram &#8220;MTL&#8221; on one side and an
engraved crest on the other. The crest seems to be
an adaptation of the Todd family crest. The pieces
are marked with a lion, an anchor, and an old English
&#8220;G,&#8221; which are the early marks of the Gorham Silver
Company. It is assumed that this silver service was
a presentation gift to Mrs. Lincoln during the time
she was First Lady of the White House, as a letter
dated July 19, 1876, from her to her son Robert Todd
Lincoln calls his attention to a silver service in his
possession that was a gift to her from &#8220;the Citizens of
New York.&#8221;</p>

</p>
</div>
<p><span class="nowrap">By far the most</span> fanciful of all the mid-19th-century
pieces is the silver teakettle and stand (<a href='#linki_12'>fig. 11</a>) given to
General Montgomery C. Meigs by the citizens of
Washington for his work on the Washington Aqueduct.
The kettle, 18 inches high, is mounted on a base that
is
8<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches square and
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches high. The base is
made in the shape of the stone arches of the aqueduct,
and the head of George Washington, in profile, is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
depicted on the center front. There is a depression
in the top of the base for holding a small alcohol
lamp. Four rocks, one on each corner of the base,
provide support for the kettle. The kettle&#8217;s feet, in
the form of fish, rest on the rocks and are fastened
to them with hinges held by a chain and silver pin.
The pins can be released so that the kettle can be
tilted for pouring without moving it from the base.
By withdrawing all four pins, the kettle can be completely
detached from the base. The body of the
kettle is decorated with nautical designs&ndash;&ndash;waves,
fish, shells, etc.&ndash;&ndash;and cattails and lily pads. Under the
spout is an anchor entwined with a fish over the initial
&#8220;M.&#8221; A belt ornamented with stars encloses the
castellated towers of the Army Engineers symbol with
the letters &#8220;U,&#8221; &#8220;S,&#8221; and &#8220;E&#8221; on one side of the kettle.
On the other side is the inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Captain Montgomery C. Meigs U.S. Engineers
by the Corporation of Washington with a Resolution of
Thanks approved 12th March 1853 for his Report on the
Washington Aqueduct.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The handle of the kettle is in the form of a serpent&#8217;s
tail, and the spout is the serpent&#8217;s open mouth. The
lid is a nautilus shell on which stands an eagle with
raised wings. On one side of the base is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented 9th June 1854 by John W. Maury&ndash;&ndash;Mayor,
Joseph Borrows of
B<sup>d</sup>
Ald., A. W. Miller of
B<sup>d</sup>
Com. C.
Committee of the Corporation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The piece is marked &#8220;M. W. Galt &amp; Bro.,&#8221; a firm
established in Washington in 1802 that has been in
continuous business since that time.</p>
<p>Montgomery Cunningham Meigs graduated from
the U.S. Military Academy in 1836 and was soon assigned
to the Engineer Corps. Thereafter, for a
quarter of a century his outstanding talents were
devoted to many important engineering projects. His
favorite was the construction of the Washington Aqueduct,
which carried a large part of Washington&#8217;s
water supply from the Great Falls of the Potomac to
the city. This work, under his direction between 1852
and 1860, involved devising ingenious methods of controlling
the flow and distribution of the water and also
the design of a monumental bridge across the Cabin
John Branch&ndash;&ndash;a bridge that for 50 years was the
longest masonry arch in the world. At the same time
Meigs was supervising the building of wings and a new
dome on the Capitol and an extension on the General
Post Office Building.</p>
<p>During the Civil War, Meigs served as quartermaster
general, and in 1864 he was brevetted major
general. As quartermaster general he supervised
plans for the War Department Building, 1866-1867;
the National Museum Building, 1876; and an extension
of the Washington Aqueduct, 1876.</p>
<p>After his retirement, in 1882, General Meigs became
architect of the Pension Office Building. He served
as a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, was a member
of the American Philosophical Society, and one of
the earliest members of the National Academy of
Sciences.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></div>
<p>General Meigs himself gave the Museum this interesting
piece of presentation silver. He also gave
the previously described tureen (<a href='#linki_6'>fig. 5</a>) that had belonged
to Commodore John Rodgers, who was General
Meigs&#8217; father-in-law.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Cyrus W. Field became interested in the idea of a
cable across the Atlantic between Newfoundland and
Ireland in 1854. It was not a new idea, and other
shorter submarine cables had been successful, but this
was the first time a transatlantic cable had been promoted
by a man of Field&#8217;s business ability and financial
standing. Through his efforts, a governmental
charter was secured and a company of prominent New
Yorkers was formed to underwrite the venture. An
unsuccessful attempt to lay the cable was made by
the company in 1857. Field tried again in 1858; on
the fourth attempt he was successful and immediately
acclaimed as the &#8220;genius of the age.&#8221;</p>

<p>New York greeted Field with wild rejoicing, and the
city authorities set September 1, 1858, as a day of
celebration to give him an official public ovation. The
celebration surpassed anything the city had ever before
witnessed. Mr. Field and the officers of the cable
fleet landed at Castle Garden and received a national
salute. From there the procession progressed through
crowded and gaily decorated streets to the crowd-filled
Crystal Palace, where an address was given on
the history of the cable. Then the mayor of New
York gave an address honoring Mr. Field and presented
him with a gold box stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The municipal government of this city instructs me to present
to you a gold box with the arms of the city engraved thereon,
in testimony of the fact that to you mainly, under Divine
Providence, the world is indebted for the successful execution
of the grandest enterprise of our day and generation; and in
behalf of the Mayor, Aldermen and Commonalty of the
City of New York I now request your acceptance of this
token of their approbation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gold box (<a href='#linki_13'>fig. 12</a>) presented to Field by the
City of New York is in the collections of the United
States National Museum.<a name='FNanchor_0014' id='FNanchor_0014'></a><a href='#Footnote_0014' class='fnanchor'>[14]</a> It measures
4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches by
3 inches. On the lid and around an engraved representation
of the cable fleet is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The City of New York to Cyrus W. Field</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sides of the box are engraved with vignettes
depicting the landing of the cable, the planning group
at work, science and industry united, and Europe
and America united. The bottom is engraved with
the American eagle and the British shield. The inside
lid of the box is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The City of New York to Cyrus W. Field commemorating
his skill, fortitude and perseverance in originating and
completing the first enterprise for an ocean telegraph successfully
accomplished Aug. 5, 1858 uniting Europe and
America.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Significant of</span> the enthusiasm with which Field was

<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
from the wood of the Charter Oak, that was given to
him in December by the workmen of Central Park.
On August 18, seemingly without advance publicity or
elaborate preparations, there was a parade on Broadway
of the workmen of Central Park. The procession
was headed by a squad of policemen in full uniform, a
band, and a standard bearer with a muslin banner inscribed
&#8220;The Central Park People.&#8221; The men
marched in squads of four, and wore their everyday
work clothes with evergreens stuck in their hats. Each
squad carried a banner giving the name of its boss-workman.
The procession included four-horse teams
drawing wagons in which rode the workmen of the Engineers&#8217;
Department. The parade was composed of
1,100 laborers and 800 carts from Central Park and
700 laborers and carts from the new Croton Reservoir,
making a procession three miles long. Since it was
altogether unexpected, it created no little excitement
and inquiry.<a name='FNanchor_0015' id='FNanchor_0015'></a><a href='#Footnote_0015' class='fnanchor'>[15]</a></p>
<p>The tankard (<a href='#linki_14'>fig. 13</a>) has a silver spout inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Oak of this Tankard is a part of the tree in which was
preserved the Charter of the Liberties of the People of
Connecticut during a temporary success of tyranny A.D.
1687.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a silver shield on the left side with the monogram
&#8220;C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;F.&#8221; and a silver shield on the right
inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The men, working in the Central Park
Aug<sup>st</sup> 17<sup>th</sup>
1858
Present this tankard to Cyrus W. Field, as an expression of
their respect, for the untiring labor which on that Day
resulted in proving the practicability of Trans-Atlantic
Communication, by the Electric Telegraph.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The knob on the lid is made of silver and is decorated
with an anchor and a rope in silver. No maker&#8217;s
mark is discernible.</p>
<p>While the public adulation was at its peak the cable
suddenly stopped working. Immediately public opinion
changed and Field was accused of being a fake.
He suffered severe business reverses and in 1860 went
into bankruptcy. The outbreak of the Civil War
prevented any further activity on the cable until 1865.
Field engaged the world&#8217;s largest steamer, the <i>Great
Eastern</i>, to make the next attempt. The cable of 1865
parted in midocean during the laying operations, but
in 1866 experience and technical improvements won
the fight. The cable was laid and this time it continued
to operate.</p>
<p>Again Field was the darling of the American people
and he was greeted with enthusiasm. Immediately
on his return to New York in 1866 he sold enough
of his cable stock to enable him early in November to
write to those who had been hurt by his bankruptcy
in 1860 and send to each the full amount of his
indebtedness with 7 percent interest. The full amount
paid out reached about $200,000. For this action
George Peabody of New York City gave Field a silver
service.</p>
<p>The silver cake basket<a name='FNanchor_0016' id='FNanchor_0016'></a><a href='#Footnote_0016' class='fnanchor'>[16]</a> from this service is in the
United States National Museum. The shallow basket
is on a pedestal with handles on each side. The
inside of the basket is gilded. Inscribed on a plaque
on one side is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>George Peabody to Cyrus W. Field in testimony and commemoration
of an act of very high Commercial integrity
and honor, New York, 24 Nov. 1866.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inside of the foot of the basket is marked with the
lion, anchor, and &#8220;G&#8221; of the Gorham Silver Company.</p>
<p>Field continued to be active in many business
enterprises but the last years of his life were again beset
with severe financial difficulties. He and his wife
celebrated their golden wedding anniversary in 1890,
and in honor of this occasion their children presented
them with a silver gilt vase.<a name='FNanchor_0017' id='FNanchor_0017'></a><a href='#Footnote_0017' class='fnanchor'>[17]</a> The vase contains a
portion of the first Atlantic cable mounted in the base,
a part of the steamship <i>Great Eastern</i>, by which the
cable was laid, and the inscribed names of all the
Field&#8217;s children and grandchildren. It is marked
&#8220;Tiffany &amp; Co. Sterling Silver, M.&#8221;</p>
<h3>FOR DIPLOMACY AND LEGISLATION</h3>
<p>In January 1861, Dr. Samuel Lilly, physician,
politician, and judge, was sent to British India as
consul general from the United States. Dr. Lilly had
been elected a representative to the 33d Congress as a
Whig, and he served from 1853 to 1855. He also
served as a judge of various lower courts in New
Jersey. On his appointment as consul general he was
given a silver goblet<a name='FNanchor_0018' id='FNanchor_0018'></a><a href='#Footnote_0018' class='fnanchor'>[18]</a> 8 inches tall and
4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches in
diameter, having an embossed design of fruits, nuts,
and flowers. On the goblet is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<p>A Testimonial of Respect and Esteem Presented to Hon.
Samuel Lilly by a few of his Fellow Citizens without distinction
of Party; on the eve of his departure for Calcutta as
Consul-General to British India January 29, 1861.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The inside of the stem is marked with the lion, anchor,
and &#8220;G&#8221; of the Gorham Silver Company, the
word &#8220;coin,&#8221; and the figure &#8220;8.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Dr. Lilly left India in 1862 he was given a
silver pitcher and a silver tray.<a name='FNanchor_0019' id='FNanchor_0019'></a><a href='#Footnote_0019' class='fnanchor'>[19]</a> The pitcher (13
inches high and
7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches in diameter) has a tall,
slender neck with a decided downturn to the pouring
lip and a hinged lid with a thistle flower as a knob.
The neck is engraved on each side with a design of
grape leaves and grapes. The bowl of the pitcher has
eight panels embossed with scrolls of vines and flowers.
Both the tray and the pitcher are marked &#8220;Allen and
Hayes.&#8221; One side is engraved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To the Hon. Samuel Lilly, M.D.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other side is engraved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By the American Merchants in Calcutta July 1862.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The silver tray (18 inches in diameter) has a scroll-leaf
and flower design in relief around the edge. The
scroll-leaf design is repeated on the surface. The tray
is inscribed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to the Hon. Samuel Lilly M.D. by the American
Merchants Resident in Calcutta as a token of regard and
acknowledgment of the creditable manner with which he
has upheld the dignity of the office and executed the duties
appertaining to the post of Consul-General of the United
States of America in British India, Calcutta, July 4th, 1862.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr class='short' />
<p>American interest in European affairs, considerably
increased by the middle of the century, is also reflected
in the collection. In 1866 the life of the Czar of Russia
was saved from a Nihilist&#8217;s bullet by the brave action
of one of the serfs who had recently been emancipated
by royal decree. Czar Alexander II was well liked by
his own people and was regarded as an enlightened
ruler by the other nations of the West. He was especially
respected in the United States because of the
open support he gave to the Union side during the
Civil War. His escape from death was a cause for
official rejoicing in this country, and the Congress of
the United States passed a resolution of congratulations
on the deliverance of the life of the Czar and commissioned
Gustavus Vasa Fox, Assistant Secretary of the
Navy, to deliver it to the Czar. Fox set out for Europe
in one of the newly designed Monitor ships that had
proved so effective in naval fighting during the Civil
War. His Monitor was escorted by other ships of the
fleet with a large delegation of naval officers. The
party was greeted by the Russians with great acclaim,
and it was showered with gifts and honors. Many of
the interesting items given to Fox personally were bequeathed
to the United States National Museum by his
widow, Mrs. V. L. W. Fox (accession 50021, Division
of Political History). Among these objects are a silver
tray (<a href='#linki_15'>fig. 14</a>), a silver saltcellar in the shape of a chair
(<a href='#linki_15'>fig. 14</a>), and a gold snuffbox.</p>

<p>The tray and saltcellar were presented to Fox on the
estate of Prince Galitzine, one of the wealthiest members
of the Russian nobility. These two items bear
the marks of a Russian maker and are engraved &#8220;July
5, 1864,&#8221; which date marked the coming-of-age of
the Prince. On August 26, shortly after the American
delegation arrived in Russia, Fox and his party drove
to the beautiful Galitzine estate, about 12 miles from
Moscow. The members of the party were met by the
Prince and went with him to a part of the park where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
a deputation of peasants awaited them. Leader of the
peasant group was the mayor of the neighboring
village, an emancipated serf, who presented Fox with
bread and salt&ndash;&ndash;traditional symbols of Russian hospitality&ndash;&ndash;on
a silver salver and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We wish to tell the envoy that we are come to congratulate
him on his arrival, and to present him with bread and salt
and also to say that we love him, and that we shall
remember the love of his people for our country and our
sovereign.<a name='FNanchor_0020' id='FNanchor_0020'></a><a href='#Footnote_0020' class='fnanchor'>[20]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two days later, on August 28, Fox met Prince
Gortchakoff by appointment at the foreign office.
After various complimentary allusions to the manner
in which Mr. Fox had performed the delicate duties
entrusted to him by his government, the Prince, in the
name of the Emperor, presented a gold snuffbox set
with diamonds.<a name='FNanchor_0021' id='FNanchor_0021'></a><a href='#Footnote_0021' class='fnanchor'>[21]</a> The box, exquisitely chased, had
the Emperor&#8217;s miniature on the top surrounded by 26
diamonds. Six larger diamonds were set three on
each side at equal distances from the inner circle.
The Emperor was pictured in full military uniform
with various orders on his breast.<a name='FNanchor_0022' id='FNanchor_0022'></a><a href='#Footnote_0022' class='fnanchor'>[22]</a> The snuffbox
minus its decorations is part of the Gustavus Vasa Fox
collection in the Museum. The precious stones
on the lid and the miniature in the center were
bequeathed by Mrs. Fox to various members of the
family when the box (cat. 11268) was willed to the
Museum.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>A large and elaborate silver vase was presented by
the members of the U.S. Life-Saving Service to Mrs.
Samuel S. Cox in honor of the outstanding work of her
husband, who as a congressman supported various bills
for the improvement of the Service. Mr. Cox served
as Congressman for 20 years, first from Ohio and later
from New York State. He died in New York City in
1889. Two years later General Superintendent S. I.
Kimball, in behalf of a committee representing the
Service, presented the vase to Mrs. Cox. The ceremony
took place at Mrs. Cox&#8217;s home in Washington
on December 12, 1891, in the presence of a gathering
of relatives and friends.</p>
<p>The vase<a name='FNanchor_0023' id='FNanchor_0023'></a><a href='#Footnote_0023' class='fnanchor'>[23]</a> is 2 feet tall and 2 feet 1 inch in diameter;
it weighs almost 8 pounds. Its design was selected by
a subcommittee appointed by the Life-Saving Service,
and the job was awarded to the Gorham Silver
Company. The chasing is entirely the work of one
man. The base of the vase has a design of clusters of
acorns and oak leaves, and above these are dolphins
sporting in billowing waves. The body of the vase
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
begins with wide flutings between the tops of which
are shells and seaweed. These are surrounded by a
ring of marine cable. On the front, a scene represents
the lifesavers at work. In perspective some distance
out, where the sea rises in mountainous waves, there
is a wrecked vessel, and in the foreground lifesavers
are carrying the rescued to the beach. The ornamentation
that covers the top of the body of the vase
consists of a cable net in which are starfish, seaweed,
and other marine flora and fauna. A ledge formed by
a ship&#8217;s chain surmounts the net, and above this is a
profile of Mr. Cox circled with laurel. A lifebuoy
crossed with a boat hook and oar ornaments the other
side. Handles at the sides are two mermaids who with
bowed heads and curved bodies hold in their upraised
hands sea plants growing from the side of the top of the
vase. The mermaids are the only portion of the
ornamentation that was cast.</p>
<p>The vase is inscribed as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This Memorial Vase is presented to <i>Mrs. Samuel S. Cox</i>
by the members of <i>The Life-Saving Service of the United States</i>
in Grateful Remembrance of the tireless and successful
efforts of her Distinguished husband <i>The Honorable Samuel
Sullivan Cox</i> to promote the interests and advance the efficiency
and glory of the Life-Saving Service.</p>
<p>He was its early and constant friend; Its earnest and eloquent
advocate; Its fearless and faithful Champion.</p>
<p>I have spent the best part of my life in the public service;
most of it has been like writing in water. The reminiscences
of party wrangling and political strife seem to me like
nebulae of the past, without form and almost void. But
what little I have accomplished in connection with this
Life-Saving Service is compensation &#8220;sweeter than the
honey in the honeycomb.&#8221; It is its own exceeding great
reward.<a name='FNanchor_0024' id='FNanchor_0024'></a><a href='#Footnote_0024' class='fnanchor'>[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Tangible evidence of the increased role that the
United States was beginning to play in international
affairs is a silver pitcher and salver<a name='FNanchor_0025' id='FNanchor_0025'></a><a href='#Footnote_0025' class='fnanchor'>[25]</a> presented to
Judge George S. Batcheller in appreciation of his services
as president of the International Postal Congress,
which was held in Washington, D.C., in 1897. Judge
Batcheller&#8217;s international career began when President
Ulysses Grant appointed him as the U.S. judge in the
newly created International Tribunal for legal administration
of Egypt. The Tribunal had jurisdiction in
cases between foreigners of different nationalities and
also in cases of foreigners versus Egyptians. Batcheller
later served as minister to Portugal and then as manager
of European interests for various American companies.</p>
<p>The International Postal Congress presented Judge
Batcheller, its presiding officer, with a handsome urn-shaped
pitcher with the following inscription engraved
on the center front:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Le Congr&egrave;s postal de Washington &agrave; son Pr&eacute;sident le G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
George S. Batcheller Juin 1897.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pitcher,
14<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>

The &#8220;925&#8221; is circled, and the date is boxed. Accompanying
the pitcher is a silver tray with the monogram
&#8220;G&nbsp;S&nbsp;B&#8221; in script in the center. The tray is marked
on the back with an eagle in a circle to the left, an &#8220;A&#8221;
in a shield in the center, and a hammer and sickle in
a circle to the right (an unidentified mark).</p>

<h3>FOR SERVICE IN THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR</h3>
<p>One of the most controversial figures of the Spanish-American
War is represented in the Museum&#8217;s
collection of some of the silver that was presented to
Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley.<a name='FNanchor_0026' id='FNanchor_0026'></a><a href='#Footnote_0026' class='fnanchor'>[26]</a> Schley became
a national hero primarily because of his genial personality,
and he was acclaimed and supported by
the masses of the American public even while his
claims to fame were being challenged by his colleagues.</p>
<p>Admiral Schley had already had a long and illustrious
naval career before the outbreak of the war
with Spain. After his graduation from the Naval
Academy in 1860, he served on board the frigate
<i>Niagara</i> when it was detailed to bring to the United
States the first representatives from Japan to this
country. As a junior naval officer he took part in
the Civil War engagements leading up to the capture
of Port Hudson. Then followed a period with sea
duty and alternate posts ashore at the Naval Academy
and elsewhere. During this period he took part
in the capture of some Korean forts in 1871, and
later he commanded the relief expedition that rescued
the Arctic explorer Lieutenant Adolphus W. Greeley
and six of his companions near Cape Sabine, when they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
were near death, and brought them safely home after
a perilous voyage through 1,400 miles of ice.</p>
<p>The controversial period of Schley&#8217;s career began
with his appointment to command the Flying
Squadron, stationed at Hampton Roads at the
opening of the Spanish-American War, with the
arrangement that should his squadron operate with
the Atlantic Squadron in the West Indies, he would
be under its senior officer, William T. Sampson.
Since Sampson was junior to Schley in rank, this led
to the famous Sampson-Schley controversy of the war.
Despite his orders to blockade Santiago immediately,
Schley took his time getting there with his squadron,
and then he failed to establish a close blockade.
During the month-long blockade in which the two
squadrons were joined, matters were strained between
the commands. Sampson was in conference about
seven miles east of Santiago when the Spanish fleet
finally emerged from the harbor. Schley immediately
seized full command of the battle despite Sampson&#8217;s
proximity and his prompt return to action.</p>
<p>The press, probably influenced by his likable
personality, made a hero of Schley, but his fellow
naval officers felt differently. A court of inquiry held
in 1901 found Schley to be at fault, but despite this
decision he retained his public popularity, a tribute
to his affability and bluff, hearty manner.</p>
<p>The many pieces in the Museum&#8217;s collection of
presentation silver given to Schley not only attest the
recipient&#8217;s popularity but seem to express the poor
taste, debased design, and stereotyped workmanship
that was characteristic at the beginning of the 20th
century.</p>
<p>Not just one presentation piece but an entire silver
service was made from Spanish coins recovered from
the <i>Crist&oacute;bal Col&oacute;n</i> that was sunk at Santiago. The
original service consisted of 69 pieces, of which the
Museum has the table centerpiece, soup tureen and
ladle, fish platter, and a vegetable dish (cat. 39554).</p>
<p>The centerpiece, measuring 14 by 30 by 8 inches, is
designed with a circular base holding four classical
female figures. On each side of the base is a shallow
silver dish shaped like a seashell and supported by
dolphins. A shield on one side of the base bears the
following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This service made of Spanish coins recovered from the
<i>Cristobal Colon</i> sunk in the battle off Santiago de Cuba
July 3, 1898 is presented to Rear Admiral Winfield Scott
Schley by his friends in loving appreciation of his heroic
services to his country.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An eagle ornaments the opposite side of the base.</p>
<p>The covered oval soup tureen (7 inches by
13<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches; cat. 39555) bears the same inscription as the
centerpiece and is marked &#8220;S. Kirk &amp; Son Co.&#8221; The
cover, monogrammed &#8220;W&nbsp;S&nbsp;S,&#8221; has a rather effective
design of overlapped laurel leaves with clusters of
berries. The ladle (14 inches long; cat. 39556) is
monogrammed &#8220;W&nbsp;S&nbsp;S&#8221; on the bowl (4 inches in
diameter), and it has the same design as the tureen.</p>
<p>The fish platter (25 inches by 13 inches; cat. 39557)
is similar to the tureen in design. The oval vegetable
dish (11 inches by
15<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches; cat. 39558) is also
similar and is inscribed the same way, including the
mark of &#8220;S. Kirk &amp; Son Co.&#8221;</p>
<p>An elaborate silver centerpiece given to Admiral
Schley in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1902 consists of a
bowl, vase, and candelabra made to be fitted into
one unit (<a href='#linki_16'>fig. 15</a>). The large bowl (20 inches by 6
inches) is chased in marine designs and bears the
following inscriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Winfield Scott Schley, Admiral U.S.N. in
recognition of his services in destroying the Spanish Fleet
off Santiago de Cuba, July 3, 1898.</p>
<p>Twenty-thousand American citizens join in honoring valor,
fidelity to duty and a lofty generosity that exemplified the
sublimest manhood. Memphis, Tennessee, April 28, 1902.</p>
<p>There is glory enough for All.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The silver vase (32 inches high) is made to fit into
the bowl, and it has a portrait of Admiral Schley on
one side and a picture of his flagship, the <i>Brooklyn</i>, on
the other. Each end of the bowl is fitted with a
socket to hold a three-branch silver candelabra, and
there are two solid blocks of silver for insertion in the
sockets when the candelabra are not being used.
These pieces are marked &#8220;Sterling&#8221; but no maker&#8217;s
mark is visible.</p>
<p>A silver card (cat. 39518), measuring
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches by
5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches, that was presented to Schley at a dinner
given in his honor is engraved as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rear Admiral Winfield Scott Schley, U.S.N. The Commercial
club of Kansas City, Mo., November 19, 1902.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The turn of the century marks the beginning of the
popularity of loving cups as presentation pieces.
There are four loving cups in the Admiral Schley
collection.</p>
<p>The earliest of these cups bears the following
inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Rear Admiral W. S. Schley by the citizens of
Atlanta Georgia, November 4, 1899.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cup (cat. 39571), 9 inches in diameter and
14<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
inches in depth, is shaped like a vase and is decorated
with a scroll design. Each of its three handles is
attached to the cup with two applied silver oak
leaves. The piece is marked &#8220;Maier &amp; Berkley,
Atlanta, Georgia, Sterling, 385,16.&#8221;</p>

<p>Another silver cup with three handles was presented
to Schley on February 5, 1902, by the Chamber of
Commerce and the citizens of Knoxville, Tennessee,
in recognition of his services during the Spanish-American
War. This cup (cat. 39573) has the mark
of the Gorham Silver Company and the words
&#8220;Sterling, A 2219, 6 pints.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silver loving cup given to Admiral Schley by the
City of Dallas reflects the exuberance of the Texas
donors as well as the taste of the turn of the century.
It bears the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Winfield Scott Schley, Rear Admiral, U.S.N.
A token of the Affectionate Regard and Grateful Appreciation
of the City of Dallas, Texas, For His Illustrious Achievements
in the Service of our Country, October 20, 1902.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This cup (cat. 39572) measures 8 inches in diameter
and 21 inches in depth. The three handles terminate
in eagles&#8217; heads. The design pictures a battleship in
gold identified as the &#8220;U.S.S. Oregon,&#8221; a head and
laurel wreath with the words &#8220;U.S.S. Brooklyn,&#8221; and
an eagle and a star in a wreath for the &#8220;U.S.S. Texas.&#8221;
The base of the cup is decorated with three Texas
longhorns with an anchor and shield. It bears the
marks of the Gorham Silver Company.</p>
<p>The fourth loving cup (cat. 39538) is made of
vanadium steel rather than of silver. This too is a
three-handled cup. It measures 7 inches in diameter
and
12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches in depth and is decorated with the
emblem of the Masonic Order of the Mystic Shrine
and the following inscriptions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Noble Winfield Scott Schley by Syria Temple,
A.A.O.N.M.S. November 20, 1909.</p>

<p>The war with Spain is further commemorated by a
silver loving cup<a name='FNanchor_0027' id='FNanchor_0027'></a><a href='#Footnote_0027' class='fnanchor'>[27]</a> presented to Rear Admiral Charles
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
D. Sigsbee, U.S.N. Sigsbee, commissioned captain in
1897, was in command of the battleship <i>Maine</i> when
she blew up in Havana harbor in 1898. A naval
court of inquiry exonerated Sigsbee, his officers, and
crew from all blame for the disaster; and the temperate
judicious dispatches from Sigsbee at the time did much
to temper the popular demand for immediate reprisal.</p>
<p>The cup bears the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Commercial Club of St. Paul Minn. Sends Greetings to
Capt. Charles Dwight Sigsbee who as Commander of the
Auxiliary Cruiser St. Paul had a brilliant share in the Naval
Exploits of the Spanish War of 1898.</p>
<p>May you live long and prosper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marks on the cup are those of the Gorham Silver
Company and the words &#8220;Sterling,&#8221; &#8220;Patented,&#8221; and
&#8220;5 pts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Admiral Sigsbee achieved greater distinction for his
services as a scientist than as a naval hero. An outstanding
hydrographer, he made a deep-sea survey of
the Gulf of Mexico, and from 1893 to 1897 he was
chief of the Navy&#8217;s hydrographic office.</p>
<h3>FOR ARCTIC EXPLORATION</h3>
<p>In the midst of the myriad of soldiers, sailors, and
politicians who have been presented with silver
through the past two centuries, we find an arctic
explorer being given similar recognition at the beginning
of this century. Rear Admiral Robert E. Peary
was the first man to reach the North Pole, and the
United States National Museum has a collection of
silver presented to him in recognition of this achievement.</p>
<p>Peary became interested in arctic exploration as
early as 1886 and discovered he had an aptitude for its
grueling demands on several minor expeditions to
Greenland and the arctic ice cap. In 1893 he became
determined to reach the North Pole, and he spent the
next 15 years in unsuccessful attempts to achieve his
ambition. In 1908 Peary left on another polar
expedition; after a hazardous trip, he reached his
goal on April 6, 1909. His victory seemed a hollow
one because of the claim of a rival explorer that was
finally proven spurious. In October a committee of
experts appointed by the National Geographic Society
supported Peary&#8217;s claims, and in 1911 he was tendered
the thanks of Congress. Admiral Peary&#8217;s work as an
explorer had immense scientific value, as he developed
a highly efficient method of exploration which has
continued to be used advantageously.</p>
<p>Three loving cups and a replica of a ship in silver<a name='FNanchor_0028' id='FNanchor_0028'></a><a href='#Footnote_0028' class='fnanchor'>[28]</a>
that were presented to Peary are in the collections of
the United States National Museum. Two of the
cups were gifts to Peary from cities in his home state
of Maine. One loving cup (cat. 12186), 10 inches
high, is marked with the old English &#8220;T&#8221; of Tiffany
&amp; Company, &#8220;7072,&#8221; and &#8220;5 pts.&#8221; It is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To Commodore Robert Edwin Peary, U.S.N. in recognition
of his remarkable achievement in placing the flag of the
United States at the North Pole, April 6, 1909. Presented
September 23, 1909 by the City of Bangor, Me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The other loving cup from Maine (cat. 12187) is 12
inches deep and bears the Tiffany &#8220;T,&#8221; &#8220;7056,&#8221;
&#8220;Sterling,&#8221; and
&#8220;5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
pts.&#8221; The inscription reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented by the citizens of Portland, and South Portland,
Maine, To Commodore Robert Edwin Peary, U.S.N.
September 23, 1909 in recognition of his achievement in
nailing the stars and stripes to the North Pole.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The third loving cup (cat. 12188) is 18 inches high
and is marked with the lion, anchor, and &#8220;G&#8221; of the
Gorham Silver Company and with &#8220;Sterling,&#8221;
&#8220;332A,&#8221; &#8220;7 pints,&#8221; and &#8220;D. Kappa Epsilon.&#8221; The
inscription reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Presented to Commodore Robert Edwin Peary, U.S.N. by
the Delta Kappa Epsilon Association of New York City,
December 18, 1909.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1910 the Royal Scottish Geographic Society presented
Admiral Peary with a silver replica of a ship
(<a href='#linki_2'>fig. 1</a>) of the type used by Henry Hudson, John
Davis, and William Baffin in their explorations for
the Northwest Passage. The replica, representing a
ship under full sail, is 24 inches high and 20 inches
long. The foresail bears a long inscription in Latin
likening Peary to other early arctic explorers. The
marks indicate the piece was made in Great Britain.</p>
<p>Also in the Museum&#8217;s collection is a silver plaque<a name='FNanchor_0029' id='FNanchor_0029'></a><a href='#Footnote_0029' class='fnanchor'>[29]</a>
presented to Peary by the Circumnavigator&#8217;s Club in
New York. It bears the mark of Tiffany &amp; Company
and is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Circumnavigator&#8217;s Club Presented to the Immortal Navigator

</p>
</div>
<p><span class="nowrap">Of all the silver</span> pieces in the collections of the
National Museum that commemorate military prowess,
the sole piece relating to World War I was presented
to a man who achieved fame for his humanitarian
service as a diplomat&ndash;&ndash;the Honorable Brand
Whitlock, who was appointed American Minister to
Belgium in 1913. Whitlock came to the position with
a distinguished record as four-time mayor of Toledo,
Ohio, where his administration was noted for its reforms.
He had insisted on a fair deal for the working
man; he liberalized the administration of justice; he
kept the city government free of graft; and he won a
battle against the power of vested interests in the city.</p>
<p>After the invasion of Belgium in World War I,
Whitlock remained at his post where he performed
many services for the oppressed citizens. His presence
in Brussels facilitated for both friend and foe the enormous
task of organizing the distribution of food among
the civilian population of Belgium and the occupied
zone of France. In 1916 he chose to follow the
Belgian Government into exile. His activities won
him the lifelong affection and admiration of the
people of Belgium, and after the war they showered
him with evidences of their esteem. Among the many
presentation medals, documents, and miscellaneous
gifts that he received is a silver loving cup (<a href='#linki_17'>fig. 16</a>)
from the British Government. On one side the cup
bears the British coat of arms, and on the other side
is inscribed:</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">A presentation</span> piece made of polished steel is really
outside the scope of this paper, but as it has an
interesting bit of diplomatic history connected with
it, it has been included in the catalogue. The object
is a paperweight (<a href='#linki_18'>fig. 17</a>) designed by William
Jennings Bryan when he was Secretary of State. The
weight, in the form of a plowshare, was made from
swords condemned by the War Department. Thirty
of these weights were given by Secretary Bryan to the
diplomats who in 1914 signed with him treaties providing
for the investigation of all international disputes.
The shaft of the plow bears the inscription:</p>

<h3 class="clearit">TO MR. AND MRS. ROBERT TODD LINCOLN</h3>
<p>Among the pieces of presentation silver acquired in
1960 by the Smithsonian Institution is a covered urn
that was given to Mr. and Mrs. Robert Todd Lincoln
by their children on the occasion of their 50th wedding
anniversary.<a name='FNanchor_0030' id='FNanchor_0030'></a><a href='#Footnote_0030' class='fnanchor'>[30]</a> Robert Todd Lincoln, son of the
President, became a prominent lawyer in Chicago and
later served as president of the Pullman Company, as
Secretary of War in the cabinets of President Garfield
and President Arthur, and as Minister to Great Britain
under President Benjamin Harrison. The silver gilt
urn has two handles, measures 13 inches from the base
to the finial on the cover, and 7 inches at its widest
point. Bands of ornamentation feature both the
grape design and the acorn and oak-leaf design. It
is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Robert Todd Lincoln&ndash;&ndash;Mary Harlan 1868-1918</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The gilt wash, although almost completely polished
off the outside surface, still covers the inside of the
urn and its lid.</p>
<h3>TO CONGRESSMEN</h3>
<p>A silver tureen and tray<a name='FNanchor_0031' id='FNanchor_0031'></a><a href='#Footnote_0031' class='fnanchor'>[31]</a> were given to the Honorable
James R. Mann, Republican leader of the
House of Representatives, by the members of the
House in 1919. Mann was elected a Representative
from Illinois in 1897, and he remained a member
of Congress until his death in 1922. In 1912 he
became minority leader. In addition to the Mann
Act, his name is associated with other important
legislation of the period such as the Pure Food and
Drugs Act and the Woman Suffrage Amendment.</p>
<p>The tray, which holds the tureen, is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>James R. Mann Republican Leader from House Members
of the 65th Congress, March 3rd, 1919.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is marked on the back with &#8220;W. Sterling, 4086&ndash;&ndash;16
in.&#8221; The initial represents the Wallace Silver
Company.</p>
<p>The oval tureen is on a pedestal base. There is a
scroll design around the edge of the base, the edge of
the bowl, and the opening of the bowl. The piece
measures 14 inches from handle to handle, is 10
inches high, and has the initials &#8220;J&nbsp;R&nbsp;M&#8221; in <a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Standardized hyphenation">old English</ins>

including the two large handles, is
15<sup>5</sup>&frasl;<sub>16</sub>
inches. The
piece is mounted on a papier-m&acirc;che base that is
covered with silk. The engraved Chinese characters
translate as follows:</p>

<h3>TO SUFFRAGETTES</h3>
<p>Among the significant social changes that occurred in
the 19th century was the movement for woman suffrage
that began about the middle of the century as a
concerted action by a nucleus of determined women.
The crusade gained strength and numbers during
the second half of the century, and finally achieved
success with the ratification of the Suffrage Amendment
in 1920. Many women worked in this cause,
and the pieces of presentation silver in the National
Museum&#8217;s Woman Suffrage Collection constitute a
record of the most important leaders.</p>
<p>Chief spokesman of the movement and its leader
for many years was Elizabeth Cady Stanton of New
York State. She was instrumental in calling the
first Woman&#8217;s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls,
New York, in 1848, and she served as president of
the National Woman Suffrage Association from its
beginning in 1869 and as president of the National
American Woman Suffrage Association from 1890 to
1891. She continued to be an active worker in the
movement until her death in 1902, writing and
editing many works on suffrage in addition to her
administrative work.</p>
<p>On the occasion of her 80th birthday in 1895, Mrs.
Stanton was presented with a silver tray<a name='FNanchor_0033' id='FNanchor_0033'></a><a href='#Footnote_0033' class='fnanchor'>[33]</a> (8 inches
wide and
1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches deep) that is inscribed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From the Ladies of Seneca Falls, 1848-1895.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This tray, presented at a meeting at the Metropolitan
Opera House in New York City, bears on the back a
&#8220;W&#8221; in a circle, a two-headed lion in a rectangle
(probably an early mark of the Wallace Silver Company),
the word &#8220;Sterling,&#8221; and the number &#8220;2048.&#8221;</p>

<p>The life story of Susan B. Anthony is a record of 60
years of devotion and work for the enfranchisement of
women. An organizer and director of countless suffrage
activities, she was tireless in conducting campaigns
for woman suffrage. She is the one individual
who has become so identified with the fight for woman
suffrage that, more than any other, her name has
become synonymous with that term. During her lifetime
she worked in almost every capacity in the organized
movement. She became president of the
National American Woman Suffrage Association in
1892 and served until her 80th birthday in 1900. On
that occasion the Colorado Equal Suffrage Association
presented her with a miniature, three-handled loving
cup that stands only
3<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches high (<a href='#linki_19'>fig. 18</a>). In one
section of the cup there is engraved the word &#8220;Colorado&#8221;
and the state&#8217;s coat of arms; in an adjoining
section is an engraving of the state flower; and in the
third section is the following inscription:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Colorado Equal Suffrage Association to Susan B. Anthony
on her 80th Birthday 1900.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cup is marked on the bottom &#8220;Sterling, 590,
A. J. Stark &amp; Co., Denver.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was also given a silver-plated teakettle<a name='FNanchor_0035' id='FNanchor_0035'></a><a href='#Footnote_0035' class='fnanchor'>[35]</a> by the
Political Equality Club of Rochester, New York. The
stand is
3<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
inches high, and the teapot is
5<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>
inches
high. Engraved around the top of the teapot is:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>The chosen leader of the Woman Suffrage Movement
after 1900 was Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, a
vigorous organizer and campaigner who led the drive
for the constitutional amendment that was finally
ratified in 1920. Mrs. Catt founded the International
Woman Suffrage Alliance in 1902 and served as its
president until 1923. Her late years were devoted
to the cause of international peace and disarmament.</p>
<p>Mrs. Catt was the prime mover in calling the first
international conference on suffrage, which, in 1902,
welcomed representatives from nine foreign nations&ndash;&ndash;Great
Britain, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Turkey, Russia, Australia, and Chile. The delegates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
were honored guests at the National Suffrage Convention
then in session in Washington where they also
attended two congressional hearings on suffrage and
were received by President Theodore Roosevelt at the
White House.<a name='FNanchor_0036' id='FNanchor_0036'></a><a href='#Footnote_0036' class='fnanchor'>[36]</a> Mrs. Catt was given a silver tray<a name='FNanchor_0037' id='FNanchor_0037'></a><a href='#Footnote_0037' class='fnanchor'>[37]</a>

<p>The back of the tray is marked &#8220;Galt &amp; Bro. Sterling,

<p>The campaign for the first referendum in the state of
New York on woman suffrage was considered to be
the most decisive of all the state fights. New York
was divided into 12 campaign districts working under
Mrs. Catt. The campaign was most vigorously waged,
but the referendum was defeated.<a name='FNanchor_0038' id='FNanchor_0038'></a><a href='#Footnote_0038' class='fnanchor'>[38]</a> After the New
York campaign Mrs. Catt received a silver gilt tray<a name='FNanchor_0039' id='FNanchor_0039'></a><a href='#Footnote_0039' class='fnanchor'>[39]</a>
inscribed:</p>

<p>The tray is marked on the reverse &#8220;Tiffany and Co.,

<p>Mrs. Catt had started the suffrage movement in the
Philippine Islands when she visited there in 1912 and
organized the first suffrage club in Manila. In 1937
the Philippine legislature submitted the question of
votes for women to the women of the Islands themselves.
The campaign committee working out of
Manila sent native women campaigners throughout
the Islands to be sure all races and religions were
represented in the vote. Mrs. Catt raised money in
this country and sent it to the campaign committee
to help with the fight.<a name='FNanchor_0040' id='FNanchor_0040'></a><a href='#Footnote_0040' class='fnanchor'>[40]</a> Over half a million Philippine

<h3>FOR SPORTS EVENTS</h3>
<p>The earliest of the sports trophies in the collection
is an ornate belt (<a href='#linki_20'>fig. 19</a>) made of blue velvet upon
which are mounted five engraved silver plates connected
by silver straps. On the center plate is the
inscription:</p>
<blockquote>

Higham Nottingham 19th June 1880 Contested at Glasgow</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the two adjoining smaller plates has an engraving
of a man riding a high-wheeled bicycle, and

Figure 20.&ndash;&ndash;<span class='smcap'>The Vanderbilt Cup</span>, an annual award for automobile races in the early 20th century. Gift of William K. Vanderbilt, Jr. In Division of Transportation. (Acc. 131820, cat. 310894; Smithsonian photo 45992-B.)<br />
</p>
</div>
<p><span class="nowrap">Trophies were awarded</span> for competition among the
various makes of cars almost as early as the advent of
the automobile itself. The earliest such trophy in the
Museum&#8217;s collection is a three-handled, cut-glass cup<a name='FNanchor_0042' id='FNanchor_0042'></a><a href='#Footnote_0042' class='fnanchor'>[42]</a>
with a wide silver rim on which is engraved:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Automobile Club of New Jersey. Eagle Rock Hill Climbing
Contest. First Prize Nov. 5, 1901.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The prize was won by Charles E. Duryea who drove
an automobile of his own manufacture.</p>
<p>Most important of the automobile trophies was the
Vanderbilt Cup (<a href='#linki_21'>fig. 20</a>) for racing, which was established
by William K. Vanderbilt, Jr., in 1904 to bring
the best cars of foreign make to the United States so
that domestic manufacturers could observe them. It
is believed that the trophy contributed in this way to
the rapid development of the automobile in the United
States. The Vanderbilt Cup races were held annually
in the United States under the auspices of the American
Automobile Association.</p>
<p>The silver cup, measuring 23 inches high and 20
inches in diameter and weighing about 40 pounds, is
engraved with statistics of the various races&ndash;&ndash;such as
dates, winners, types of cars, distances, and times.<a name='FNanchor_0043' id='FNanchor_0043'></a><a href='#Footnote_0043' class='fnanchor'>[43]</a>
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
There is a wreath around the brim, and the front is
decorated with a period racing car in repouss&eacute;. The
inscription reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Challenge Cup Presented by W. K. Vanderbilt Jr. American
Automobile Assn. under deed of gift to be raced for yearly
by cars under 1000 kilos.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the inside of the stem is marked &#8220;Tiffany and Co.&#8221;
and &#8220;35 pints.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Athletic trophies in the collection include eight
silver and silver-plated loving cups awarded for athletic
events to the crew members of various ships of the
U.S. Navy.<a name='FNanchor_0044' id='FNanchor_0044'></a><a href='#Footnote_0044' class='fnanchor'>[44]</a> The sporting events represented include
baseball and football games, canoe and cutter races,
and track meets held among the fleet between 1903
and 1915.</p>
<h3>TROWELS FOR CORNERSTONE LAYING</h3>
<p>The National Museum also has a small collection of
silver trowels used for laying cornerstones of public
buildings. There is an ivory-handled trowel (<a href='#linki_22'>fig. 21</a>)
with the inscription:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The back of this trowel (cat. 38208) is marked
&#8220;Sterling.&#8221;</p>
<h3>FIRE TRUMPETS</h3>
<p>Three fire trumpets in a collection<a name='FNanchor_0046' id='FNanchor_0046'></a><a href='#Footnote_0046' class='fnanchor'>[46]</a> on loan from
the Insurance Company of North America are inscribed
